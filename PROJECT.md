<h1 align="center">Instructions for running the Jupyter Notebook file</h1>

The whole implementation of the challenge is in a Jupyter Notebook file in the root folder of the project, named "RMSE from NetCDF data English.ipynb". It is not necessary to run it to visualize the results, simply open it on Github and you will visualize the maps and graphs in a static way. Only the results of the PIP install have been hidden for aesthetic reasons. 

If you need to run the script, you can run it in Google Colab environment as is (including pip commands) or locally, being necessary to run pip commands only if the libraries are not installed.

### Pre-requisites
The following libraries were used for the development of this Jupyter Notebook file:

XArray
Pandas
GeoPandas
PyGeoHash
GeoPlot
Shapely
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

### Execution
It is recommended to run it using Jupyter Notebook. The Anaconda distribution has the Jupyter Notebook, as well as some pre-installed libraries, such as Pandas.

In the notebook, there are text boxes before each coding line explaining and justifying the decisions made.
